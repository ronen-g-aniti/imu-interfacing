# MPU9250 Sensor Calibration and Data Processing

Welcome to the MPU9250 Sensor Calibration and Data Processing project. This repository contains the code to calibrate and process data from the MPU9250 sensor, ensuring accurate readings for accelerometer and gyroscope data. The project aims to provide reliable sensor data for applications in defense technology, aligning with my mission to bolster national security through innovative engineering and strong collaboration.

## Project Overview

The code in this repository performs the following tasks:
- Initializes the MPU9250 sensor.
- Calibrates the sensor to account for offsets in accelerometer and gyroscope readings.
- Applies a moving average filter to smooth the sensor data.
- Outputs the raw and filtered data in a format compatible with the Arduino Serial Plotter.

## Key Features

- **Sensor Initialization:** Properly configures the MPU9250 sensor for accurate data readings.
- **Sensor Calibration:** Automatically calculates and applies offsets to ensure that accelerometer and gyroscope readings are correct when the device is stationary.
- **Data Smoothing:** Uses a moving average filter to smooth out noise in the sensor data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mpu9250-sensor-calibration.git
